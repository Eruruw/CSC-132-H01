Beginning

Hey, I'll be your partner for this assignment!
I hope we get along.

- I hope so too.
	a += 1
	With optimism like that, I'm sure we will!
	So, any ideas for the assignment?

	- Maybe a robot of some sort?
		a +- 0
		Not exactly my area of expertise, but maybe.
		I'd really have to place my trust in you, though.

		- No worries, I have confidence in us.
			a += 1
			That's good to hear!
			Maybe this project will be easier than I thought.

			- I sure hope so.
				a +- 0
				Don't think about it too much!
				We'll come across any bridges as we get to them.
				Anyway, should we meet again later?

				- Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
					a += 1
					Cool, looking forward to working with you!
					See you later, yeah?

				- I can't, I'm busy.
					a +- 0
					Oh, that's fine. Just let me know when you're free.
					Talk to you later!

			- Isn't that a little too optimisic?
				a -= 1
				This early on? Maybe, but it's a good mindset, right?
				We should remain optimisic if we want to get anywhere.

				- Maybe you're right.
					a += 0
					I know I'm right!
					Anyway, it's getting late, so I'll be off.
					See you later!

				- I don't know about that...
					a +- 0
					Oh, come on, lighten up a little!
					Well, I've gotta go.
					We'll talk about this again later.

		- We'll see as we go along.
			a +- 0
			I suppose you have a point.
			Can't know anything until we try, right?

			- Not a bad outlook.
				a += 1
				I'm glad you agree!
				So, should we meet again later?

				- Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
					a += 1
					Cool, looking forward to working with you!
					See you later, yeah?

				- I can't, I'm busy.
					a +- 0
					Oh, that's fine. Just let me know when you're free.
					Talk to you later!

			- Granted, it would be better if we knew before.
				a +- 0
				Haha, well, I won't say you're wrong there.
				But where's the fun without a little discovery?
				Don't you think this will be fun?

				- I don't particularly enjoy projects, so not really.
					a -= 1
					That's not the greatest mindset for a group project.
					It'll only make it harder to work, you know?
					Either way, we'll work it out later. Take care.

				- I think it will be, if we work together!
					a += 1
					Yeah, I'm looking forward to it!
					That being said, I'll contact you later about the details.
					Talk to you then!

				- If all goes well, it could be.
					a +- 0
					This isn't about success or faiure, I think you missed the point.
					It's about our progression as students and future workers.
					Either way, I'm looking forward to watching your outlook change later!
					With that, I'll be on my way. Peace!

			- Sure, if you live recklessly.
				a -= 1

	- How about a program to demonstrate some particular skill?
		a +- 0
		That sounds really fun! I wonder what we can manage.
		Do you think you'll be able to handle the work involved?

	- I'm not quite sure yet.
		a +- 0
		No big deal! It's the first day, anyway.
		We might be able to create something naturally.
		As long as we stay on task, it'll turn out fine.

	
- As long as we get the work done.
	a +- 0
	I'm sure everything will come as we go.
	So, any ideas for the assignment?

- I wonder if we will?
	a -= 1
	There's no need to doubt me!
	Maybe you could try being a little more optimisitic?

	- And maybe you could try being a little less annoying?
		a -= 1
		This seems like it'll be a long project...
		So, any ideas for the assignment?

		- Maybe a robot of some sort?
			a +- 0
			That doesn't really fit in my area of expertise.
			And no offense, but I don't know if I can trust you.

		- How about a program to demonstrate a particular skill?
			a +- 0
			That's not a bad idea, and we can work separately too.
			Can I really trust you to get your work done?

		- I'm not quite sure yet.
			a +- 0
			Nothing wrong with that.
			But with the way we're going, we should start something soon.
			I just have a feeling this is going to be a long journey.

	- Sorry, I didn't mean anything by that.
		+- 0
		Still a little cold, don't you think?
		We can't work well together if we don't understand each other.
		So, any ideas for the assignment?

		- Maybe a robot of some sort?
			a +- 0
			I'm not experienced with robots, but it may work out.
			At least, if you're willing to be patient with me.

		- How about a program to demonstrate a particular skill?
			a +- 0
			No complains here, we can get that done.
			We both need to contribute though, you know?

		- I'm not quite sure yet.
			a +- 0
			Just keep on brainstorming ideas.
			When we come up with something, we need to start working.

	- Maybe you're right. We'll do fine.
		a += 1
		That's the spirit! Let's do this!
		So, any ideas for the assignment?

		- Maybe a robot of some sort?
			a +- 0
			I probably won't be of much help there, honestly.
			But if you think you could find something we can both do, I'm game.

		- How about a program to demonstrate a particular skill?
			a +- 0
			Maybe not the most inspired, but probably our best bet.
			I'll be ready to work on it when you are.

		- I'm not quite sure yet.
			a +-
			Is that so? No pressure, of course.
			I'll continue to think of ideas, too.

Branching Path - Positive (a > 1)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branching Path - Netural (-2 < a < 2)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Branching Path - Negative (a < -1)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Best Ending (b > 3) (Possible from Positive path)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Good Ending (b > 1) (Possible from Positive and Netural paths)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Netural Ending (-2 < b < 2) (Possible from all paths)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Bad Ending (b < -1) (Possible from Netural and Negative paths)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Worst Ending (b < -3) (Possible from Negative path)
